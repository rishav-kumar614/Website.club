export const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "What does renting a website mean?",
    a: "You pick a finished Website Club experience, we customize it with your brand, content and domain, and you pay a monthly plan instead of a large upfront build cost. Hosting, maintenance and support are part of that plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use my own domain?",
    a: "Yes. Every rental launches on your own domain. We handle the DNS and SSL setup with you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you customize a rental website?",
    a: "Yes. We replace the branding, copy, imagery, colors, products and information. Deeper structural changes can be scoped as a custom project.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can another company use the same design?",
    a: "Rental designs are shared starting points, so the underlying layout can appear with more than one client. Your branding, content and domain are your own, and we can discuss exclusivity for specific designs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I stop paying?",
    a: "A rental is a subscription. If you cancel, the site is taken offline at the end of your paid period. The rental terms cover the details, including how to export your content.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to launch?",
    a: "Rentals are the fastest path because the experience already exists. Timelines depend on how much content and customization you need; we give you a clear schedule before work starts.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build completely custom websites?",
    a: "Yes. We design and develop original interactive 3D websites around your brand, product and story, from strategy through launch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you redesign my existing website?",
    a: "Yes. We can rebuild it from scratch, or keep what works and add 3D, motion and interactive sections on top of it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you create the 3D models?",
    a: "Yes. 3D design and modeling are part of the studio. If you already have models, we can optimize and use them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the website work on mobile?",
    a: "Yes. Mobile is designed separately, not shrunk down from desktop. Scenes are simplified, and heavier ones fall back to rendered imagery or video where needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will 3D make my website slow?",
    a: "It shouldn't. Models are compressed, scenes load lazily after the page is readable, and low-powered devices get lightweight fallbacks. Performance is part of the brief, not an afterthought.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will 3D hurt my SEO?",
    a: "Not when it's built properly. All headings, copy and links live in plain HTML that search engines read directly, and the 3D scene loads after the page is already readable, so it never blocks content or first paint.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who owns the website and my content?",
    a: "Your brand, copy, imagery and domain always stay yours. On a rental, the underlying design and code stay with Website Club and are licensed to you while your plan is active. On custom builds, ownership terms are set out in the project agreement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I eventually purchase a rented website?",
    a: "This is something we can discuss. Buy-out options for specific designs are handled case by case and are covered in the rental terms.",
